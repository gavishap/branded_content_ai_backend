        "Full Text": "This is how I made my first million and then flipped it into a billion. We set up this website called broadcast.com. We started what turned out to be the very first streaming company. On July 18th, 1998. We went public. All of a sudden, I'm worth $300,000,000 plus. and I'm sitting there thinking, \"Oh, F*ck.\" If this stock price triples... I'm a billionaire. And Yahoo! came along and made us an offer. And all of the sudden, that stock price tripled, and I was a billionaire. And I'd seen stocks go up. And I'd seen stocks go down. I sold some of the upside to that Yahoo! stock that they gave me. I protected myself by buying puts on the downside. 3 months later, the internet stock market cratered. It was called one of the top 10 Wall Street trades of all time. Wow! That is so smart. If the stock price goes up, I make money. If the stock price goes down, the puts go up, and my value stays exactly the same. Man, that worked out well.",
