        "Full Text": "I just got a package from Tesla. Now some of you guys may know that I have a Tesla Model Y. Ever since I got my Model Y, I wanted one of these, well Tesla never sold it. And just a few days ago, they came out with this in their Tesla shop. This is a 1 and 18th scale Tesla Model Y. The attention to detail on this is just incredible. The steering wheel actually works. You open up the trunk and it has a felt lining inside. I mean you can see the Tesla brakes behind each wheel. There's even little tiny seat belts with the latch that are for some reason very detailed. The seat adjustment buttons and the window controls are on it just like the real one. The side mirrors and the rearview mirror are real mirrors. But I can't open the frunk, so if anyone has any ideas on how to do that, let me know. And I just noticed this now, the windshield wipers actually move. Let me know what you guys think in the comments, but man, I am super impressed.",
